# Design-of-heterogenous-reactors

Some heterogenous reactor projects that I have carried out. Each folder is a different project. 
The projects consist of a common part and an individual part. The problem statement of both parts is the same pdf (individual part is 
below common part and this correspond to the pdf title that must be found in pdf problem statement). The projects include the Matlab 
codes used.
